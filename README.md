# Land Use and Land Cover Classification using Satellite Images
The main resource controlling primary productivity for terrestrial ecosystems can be defined in terms of land: the area of land available, land quality, moisture regime and edaphic character. Despite successful substitution of land-based resources with fossil fuels and mineral resources, land remains of prime importance. Land cover and land use represent the integratal elements of the resource base. Classifying and mapping land cover is an integral step in understanding the Earth's biophysical systems. Data on the area and distribution of wildlife habitat, for example, are useful in managing and mitigating development impacts on protected and endangered species. Similarly, information on the type, area, and configuration of buildings, roads, and other impervious land-cover facilitates the modeling of storm-water runoff and watershed hydraulics and hydrology.

This project provides classified information from the images (i.e. the semantics) automatically for dynamic inputs. This systematic and dynamic system could provide the information needed in various sectors like agriculture, land use planning etc. This will help in appropriate land planning. The semantics provided would not only benefit agricultural organisations but also the farmers, researchers and educational agricultural institutes. 

### Objectives
1. To create a precise description and classification of land cover which will be useful in addressing the ever increasing problems related to land cover and their use which will in turn be beneficial to various sectors of agriculture, industry, wildlife, human settlements etc. 
2. To ensure that the use of land cover and activities on them create pre conditions for a favourable living environment and promote ecologically, economically, socially and culturally sustainable development.
3. A standardized, consistent and accurate classification system containing systematic and strict class boundary definitions, using remote sensing techniques to map land cover and land use from a series of multi-spectral satellite images based on time series analytics will help us achieve this objective to a great extent.

### Dataset
The dataset used is EuroSAT. It consists of 27,000 spanning over 10 classes. The dataset is openly available at <a>https://github.com/phelber/EuroSAT</a>.
